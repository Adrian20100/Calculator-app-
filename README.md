Calculator App

A simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project was created by following a YouTube tutorial and making small modifications to better understand the logic and structure of a calculator application.

The goal of this project was learning and practice, not originality.

Description

The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations using button inputs.
JavaScript is used to manage the calculator state, handle user interactions, and update the display dynamically.

Features

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Clear (C) button

Delete last digit functionality

Integer-based calculations

Button-based input

Simple and responsive layout

Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (ES6)

How It Works

The display is updated using DOM manipulation

Button clicks are handled through event delegation

A buffer stores the current number input

A running total stores intermediate results

Operations are executed when an operator or equals button is pressed
